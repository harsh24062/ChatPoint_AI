# Stage 1: Build the Spring Boot application using Maven and Eclipse Temurin JDK (Alpine-based)
FROM maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-17-alpine AS build

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy all project files
COPY . .

# Build the application (skip tests for speed)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Use a smaller secure image with just the JRE to run the app
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the built JAR file from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose the port your Spring Boot app listens on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the JAR file
